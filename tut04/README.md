Notes
Chapter 7
- avoid backlogs
- time spent reviewing and organizing backlogs is waste
- alternative: before 6-week cycle, hold betting table
    - only look at pitches from last 6 weeks or ones some personally lobbies
    - this reducing number of pitches to review avoiding backlog
    - if we decide to bet it goes into next 6-week cycle otherwise we drop it
    - we don't have to completely abandone unused ideas or backlogs, we leave it to individuals to keep track of bugs or requests
- lists are decentralized
- prmotes shared responsibility amongs the entire group rather thatn falling upon a single individual
- Important Ideas will stick with you
    - there are many ideas proposed at any given moment, but most are forgottne. Really important ideas stick around whether it's just harder to forget or it keeps popping up as a problem/soltuion or just imade impact on others
Chapter 8
- hard to assign work to people when availability diffes
- solution is to work in standardized cycle
- some commpanies use 2-week cycle but those are two short to get meaningful work done and they are too costly to plan
- cycle must be long enough to get meaningful work done, but short enough to give pressure of a deadline
- eventually we got to 6-week cycle
- after 6-week cycle is 2-week cool-down
- cool-down gives programmers break to work on what they want and gives time to plan next 6-week cycle
- must also standardize teams/project sizes
    - this couldd be 1 developer & 2 programmers, or 1 devloper & 1 programmer
- teams can work on one project for full 6 weeks (big batch) or several smaller projects (small batch) that take 1-2 weeks each
- betting table is meeting during cool-down where stakeholders decide tasks and assigments for next 6-week cycle
- betting table is for high-level personel and short (1-2 hours)
- result of meeting is cycle plan
- point of a bet is capping how much time is lost on failure, committing uniterrupted time, and defining specific payout
- 6-week cycle must be uniterrupted, and issues can be dealt with in the next 6-week cycle
- circuit breaker; project stops at 6-week cycle and might not ship out if unfinished. Ensures we don't dedicate more time unnecessarily
- bugs are usually not crippling andtherefore can be let to the next 6-week cycle or within the 2-week cooldown
    -  also do "bug smash" around holiday time
- always only bet one cycle in advance; any leftover work can be shaped an pitched in the next one
Chapter 9
- new products follow 3 phases of work when building from scratch
    - R&D mode
        - bet time on spike key peices instead of a well-shaped pitch
        - have senior team do build because we don't know what we want or architectural restrictions
        - will not ship anything at end of cycle, purpose is to learn what works
    - Production mode
        - foundation is set, we can now bring in other programmers and mover towards formal shaping and betting
        - shipping is now the goal
    - Cleanup mode
        - no shaping, much more similar to "bug smash" with leader pointing out what is most important
        - no clear team boundaries, everyone helps wherever they can
        work is shipped coninuously in smallest chunks possible
- questions to aks during betting
    - does the problem matter?
        - only solve important or major issues
    - is the appetite right?
        - maybe issue was not well articulated or there is another underlying issue
        - idea intersest might be too low and therefore not worth
    - is solution attractive?
    - is this right time?
    - are right people available?
- kick-off message to tell people what prjoecst they're betting on and who's doing what for the next cycle

Summaries
 Chapter7
Now that the pitch is done, we have to make sure we don't start adding to a backlog that we keep locing back at. Backlogs are a list of tasks that we hadn't done because they were either not that important or to costly to do at the time. Looking back on these tasks and organizing them into tasks we can do it the next cycle is far too time consuming and keeps us stuck in the past. The alternative is the betting table. Here, we gather pitched ideas in the last 6-week cycle that are well-shaped and low-risk or any ideas someone personally lobbies. This way we are only looking at a few good ideas rather than all of the ideas we've ever had. Once we decide on an idea it goes into the next 6-week cycle and others are dropped. However, any ideas we didn't take can still be tracked by an individual and purposefully lobbied at the next betting table. This helps spread the responsibility of tracking across many people across different departments. While there is only so much we can do, we can feel safe that critical ideas will pass the betting table eventually because the larger more inmportant ideas tend to stick around. Whether that be as and idea that starts to get more traction or the problem it solves becomes more and more apparent.

 Chapter8
When it comes to acutally scheduling tasks and coordinating with people it can easily become a logistical night mare when everyone has different avalabilities. We can remedy this problem by having standardized cycles so we know exactly when people are working on what and when they will be done. Some companies have tried 2-week cycles called "sprints" but these cycles are too short to perform any meaningful work and are far too costly to plan. When we decide the lenght of the cycle we have to leave enough time for a fairly significant or impactful project to be done, but we also have to have it short enough that we feel the pressure of an upcoming deadline. Eventually we arrived a 6-week period for programmers and developer to dedicate themselves to and a 2-week cool-down period for shaping & betting next cycle's projects as well as giving people a breather. Programmers can use this time to fix bugs or work on what they want instead. Now that we've standardized the schedule we also need to standardize the teams and project size. We currently do this by having 1 devloper & 2 programmers or 1 devopler & 1 programmer. The project size gets broken up into either big batches, which will require the full six weeks, or small batches, which are a list of smaller tasks that may take 1-2 weeks each. The betting table occurs during the cool-down period and is a meeting held by some of the highest ranking individuals to decide what they will be dedicating their time and resources to which will result in the cycle plan.

 Chapter 9
We now need to look at where we are in our progress. With already existing products we're simply building features for an already made product, but with an entirely new product, we have will find ourselves somewhere within the 3 phases. In R&D mode we are testing out ideas to see what is feasible and whether this idea really has any legs to stand on. In this case we will only dedicate senior programers to the build because they need to determine what the underlying architecture will look like and whether this is even possible at all. We're not going to be shipping naythign at the end of the cycles because we're just trying to build a foundation, we also won't have any shaping because we don't really know what we want at this stage. The next stage is the production phase. At this stage we have a basic understanding of what can be done and what direction we want to go in moving forward. We can now start shaping more specific ideas\features and introduce new programmers as we've already laid down the foundation to build upon. We will now be shipping these features and the end of the cycels. After sometime in the production phase, we will eventually come to a near finished product and end up in Cleanup mode. This is the franting end of project phase that doesn't have any real structure. The teams are just trying to touch some rough edges and everyone is helping out wherever they can or are needed as boundaries between teams fade. This is the mad dash before launching the product. While we have to make sure we have enough time to iron out the most hurtful kinks, we also can't stall forever. During the betting process there will be many questions about appetite, timing, and problem significance as negotiations. These will usually lead to understanding hidden or correlated issues and narrow donw what exactly the stakeholder wants'expects. Once all is said and done, there needs to be a kick-off message explaining what they will be betting on and who will do what during the next cycle.
