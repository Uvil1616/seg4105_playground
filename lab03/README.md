Shaping:

 The customer has to fill out every field in a service request every single time they submit one. Even if it's multiple at once, they will still have to rewrite their personal information every single time. Customers have found this to be time consuming and repetitive which further dissuades them from using our website. A maximum of 2 weeks will be spent implementing a solution to the proposed problem. While a helpful feature, it does not require a redesigning of the website or any overhauling, thus it is not worth implementing if the time requirement exceeds 2 weeks. The solution is to give the customer the ability to create an account with our website. This account will save all personal information, so that if they need submit a service request, they only need to fill out the type of service required while the rest can be auto-completed. The main issue with this is creating a database from scratch. We will need to have constraints attached to the database to filter what goes into what fields, but great detail is not necessary at this point. For now we may rely on user descretion for data input. What we are not doing is creating any kind of social platform. These accounts will be independent of each other and have no interaction. The purpose of these accounts it to securely store information that may need to be repeated when filling out forms
