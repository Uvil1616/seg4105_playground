Chapter 2 Principles of Shaping
-shaping is about not being to concrete (models and mmwireframes) and not being to abstract (just words with too broad an idea)
-it's like a very rough draftmeant to solve a very specific use case, the general idea of elements and overlay are there but exact implementation is left to the discretion of the developers/programmers. this tells of also what is out of scope
- done in small groups with people who have general knowledge or varying people with different experties, but collaborators must be technically literate (they must understand what is possible and what is not)
-two groups in working in parallel, the developers are working on whatever was shape in previously while the shapers are deciding on what the develop in the future
-steps: set boundaries, rough out elements, address risks and rabbit holes, write the pitch

The shaping process is about creating a general concept that is neither too concrete in its definition nor too vague in its scope. It's like a very rough draft designed to solve a specific use case or a problem a user is having. We figure out how to solve this problem with very primitive diagrams just to get an idea of how the solution would be achieved. This leaves a lot of room for the developers and programmers to figure out which components we'll actually use and how they'll fit together. By focusing on on use case we're also able to weed aout anything that is out of scope or unnecessary for our current solution. The shaping process and the developing of the software are to groups that will be working in parallel. While the development team is working implementing the idea that's been shaped, the shaping team will be shaping up the next feature at the same time. The whole shape up process follows a set of steps: setting the boundaries, roughing out the elements, addressing any risks and rabbit holes, and finally writing the pitch

Chapter 3 Boundaries
- start with raw idea and set broad terms
- appetite is essentially how much time we're willing to invest in the idea
- small batch is type of appetite that can be done by few programmers in 1-2 weeks, big batch requires full team for 6 weeks
- appetite is different from estimate, appetite is more like a creative constraint
- fixed time variable scope forces us to make decisions on what to include and hwat we don't have time for
- don't commit to raw ideas, leave timme to analyze whether it's worth it
- ask when raw ideas occur, what exactly is someone trying to do, this will narrow down the scope
-avoid grab-bags which are again general undefined request not driven by a single scenario

When shaping a feature we need to set some boundaries, not necessarily to get into any specifics but because we don't want to waste time on anythin unnecessary. For this we will have to keep in mind our current appetite. The appetite is a measure of how much time we are currently willing to spend on solving the problem at hand. We can generally categorize our appetite into small batches or big batches. A small batch is a fairly simple implementation that can be done in 1-2 weeks with minimial programmers dedicating their time to it while a big batch is much more cumbersome and will require the use of the full team and the full 6 weeks to achieve. The appetite is meant as more of a creative constraint. With the appetite in mind we now have a fixed time, but the nature of shape-up leaves us with a still variable scope. That forces us to make decisions on what we can and cannot spend time trying to solve. This is why we don't commit to raw ideas, because we need time to determine whether it's worth solving or not. When raw ideas occur it is best to ask what exactly the user is trying to do or what their end goal was at the time, this allows us to considerably narrow the scoper and avoid grab-bags generated from a general request withou any specific goal in mind

Chapter 4 Find the Elements
- work alone or with someone quickly, the idea is to come up with components or designs that functionaly solve the prblem without getting caught up in the details
- places: tells use where the user can navigate to, affordances: things the user can interact with like buttons or fields, Connection lines: show how affordances take users from place to place
- work quickly with design flows to see how the user might navigate through the page to achieve a certain task or draw a layout and think about what it's missing or what should be displayed more prominently to add a bit more structure wihout getting too specific
- theme of shaping process is to slowly get more and more concrete while leaving room for creativity in subsequent steps

To then find the elements we want to quickly come up with solutions that simply wolve the problem at hand. This can be done with simple design flows listing the pages and affordances found and mapping through the process of fufilling a certain task. With design the same can be done with a fat marker sketch. We design the rough layout of the software without getting into too specific details. We're mainly looking for what stands out or what appears to be missing. The theme of shaping up is to slowly get more and mroe concrete as we go while still leaving room for creativity down the road

Chapter 5 Risks and Rabbit Holes
- unexpected problems occur which is slightly aided by the room we made in previous steps
- we want to make sure the probability the project finishes around the the time we set is as thin as possible by removing unknowns and tricky problems
- look for holes in the design, assumptions made early on about how a problem would be solved or how components might fit together
- as shapers we're more concerned about the quality and risk than the best possible design
- need to declare which use cases are out of bounds
- bring in a technical expert and walk them through the idea with a white board drawing or somethign equally informal, keep it as an idea and not something concrete, their input will either validate it or return it to the shaping process
- now that the idea is more solid, it is ready to be written up, clearly defined, and pitched

As we shape-up we will undoubtedly come across risks and rabbit holes. Unexpected problems were bound to arise which is why we left room from earlier steps. We know want to reduce the amount of uknown variables or tricky problems that we have to reduce the overall rsik of following through with this idea. As shapers we are far more concerned with creating something with high quality and low risk rather than looking for the best possible design. This means we need to declare what is out of bounds and what isn't. This also means bringin in a technical expert and walking them through the rough idea from scratch so they may follow our thought process. Here they may point aout assumptions we made or how viable our project really is. With this meeting either our idea will be validated or sent back to the shaping process.
